### Description
In this project I learned a great deal about HTML5's proper structuring and it's importance for when you work with other developers. I learned how crucial it is to leave clear and concise notes for any future or present developers that might work on the site. 
Without proper structure and notes programming becomes unnecesarily complicated and can make working a stressful endeavor. Efficiency is key when programming. What motivated me to work on this project was that the client was a digital marketing agency, and that is the industry I am most interested in working in.
